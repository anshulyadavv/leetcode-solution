# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains well-documented solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in C++, Java and Python. Each solution includes:
- **Problem description**
- **Approach and explanation**
- **Time and space complexity analysis**
- **Test cases**

---

## **Repository Structure**
Solutions are categorized based on data structures and algorithms for easier navigation:

```
/arrays
/linked-lists
/trees
/graphs
/dynamic-programming
/math
/strings
```

Alternatively, solutions can be grouped by difficulty:

```
/easy
/medium
/hard
```

Each folder contains files named after the problem they solve, e.g., `two_sum.py` or `merge_sorted_lists.cpp`.
